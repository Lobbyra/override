0. The binary is heavily protected, so we need to exploit it using the data we send.
1. In the main part of the program, if a specific function call returns 0, it will execute a system('/bin/sh') command.
2. The main part reads a string and an unsigned integer from stdin using fgets and scanf respectively.
3. There is a function called Auth that checks for debugging tools like gdb or ltrace to prevent live binary inspection.
4. In Auth, an integer is created and initialized based on the third character of the string.
5. Then, each character of the string is processed in a loop, modifying the integer based on the character's value (similar to a hashing function).
6. If the final integer (hash) matches the integer from stdin, the function returns 0. For example, "hellofriedn" and 6238200 form a matching combination that gives shell access.
