0. We firstly saw that the binary is nearly full protected with the checksec. So we deduct that we have to exploit the binary by the data we send.
1. We saw that in the main, the program will execute a system('/bin/sh') if a function call return 0.
 . The main listen stdin for a string and an unsigned with fgets and scanf respectivly.
2. This function is name Auth and first check ptrace to protect against gdb, ltrace and any other live binary inspection
3. Next to that, the program create an integer and init it to a value based on the third character.
4. After that, the function loop into each char of the string and edit the integrer based on the value of the current character. This is like a hashing function.
5. Finally, the function return 0 if the integer (hash) is equal to the integer from stdin.
6. Here is a matching combinaison that get a shell : hellofriedn, 6238200
